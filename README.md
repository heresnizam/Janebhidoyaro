## General Information
1. **Project Name**: What is the name of the project or application being deployed?
2. **Deployment Environments**: What environments are involved (e.g., development, staging, production)?
3. **Version Control System**: Which version control system is being used (e.g., Git, SVN)?
 
## Pipeline Configuration
4. **Pipeline Type**: Are you using a Declarative or Scripted pipeline? Why?
5. **Jenkinsfile Location**: Where is the Jenkinsfile located (e.g., in the root of the repository)?
6. **Pipeline Triggers**: What triggers are set up for the pipeline (e.g., webhooks, scheduled builds)?
 
## Stages and Steps
7. **Stages Definition**: What stages are defined in your pipeline (e.g., Build, Test, Deploy)?
8. **Steps in Each Stage**:
   - What specific steps are included in each stage?
   - Are there any conditional steps based on environment variables or parameters?
 
## Tools and Plugins
9. **Tools Configuration**: What tools are configured in your pipeline (e.g., Maven, Gradle)? How are they specified?
10. **Plugins Used**: Which Jenkins plugins are utilized for deployment? Are there any specific configurations for these plugins?
 
## Deployment Process
11. **Deployment Method**: How is the deployment executed (e.g., SSH, API calls)?
12. **Environment-Specific Configurations**: Are there any environment-specific settings or configurations? How are they managed?
13. **Rollback Mechanisms**: Is there a rollback strategy in place? If so, what does it entail?
 
## Testing and Validation
14. **Testing Frameworks**: What testing frameworks are integrated into the pipeline?
15. **Validation Steps**: Are there any validation steps after deployment? How are they performed?
 
## Notifications and Monitoring
16. **Notification Setup**: How does the team get notified about build and deployment statuses (e.g., emails, Slack messages)?
17. **Monitoring Tools**: Are there monitoring tools integrated to track application health post-deployment?
 
## Documentation and Maintenance
18. **Documentation Practices**: How is the pipeline documented? Is there a centralized location for documentation?
19. **Maintenance Procedures**: What procedures are in place for maintaining and updating the pipeline?
 
This questionnaire will provide a structured approach to documenting Jenkins deployment workflows, ensuring that all critical aspects are covered for effective management and improvement of CI/CD processes.
